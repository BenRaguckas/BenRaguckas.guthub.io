            <p>My primary work experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had to work as part of DevOps team maintaining and ensuring successful deployment of a product.</p>
<p>I have worked with Docker, Kubernetes, Helm utilizing Jenkins and Spinnaker for pipelines and automation.</p>
<p>While working we dealt little with code but were responsible for its integration, deployment, documentation and testing.</p>

        <div class="skills-item-content">
            <p>I have learned a lot about Docker and Kubernetes in my work placement.</p>
<p>Over the time I have also tried to apply these skills to personal project where I was able to deploy a local web-app on Raspberry Pi through Docker.
I also apply it in projects / assignments wherever possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Final Year Project is oriented around Containerisation and Orchestration. Where I’m trying to deploy a full stack application utilizing message broker and orchestrated using Helm and Kubernetes.</p>

            <p>My 2nd year team project was oriented around Agile Development Cycle and Test Driven Development (TDD).</p>
<p>My Agile skills were further expanded during my work experience and even though it we were dealing with integration my testing skills have also significantly improved from it.</p>

            <p>In my work placement I had to deal with Unix based systems heavily. But even before that I was familiar with them from virtualization side. Since then, I ended up using Ubuntu on my personal laptop to speed up any development processes and I have become comfortable interfacing with servers or VMs through terminals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some systems I have dealt with:</p>

<p>I have developed few demo apps in Android Studio but since I had moved to Flutter I have been focused on a single Time-table app project. It utilizes few different elements and has become a passion project of mine for the time being.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web requests</li>
<li>HTML parsing</li>
<li>Dynamic Display</li>
<li>Using MVC pattern</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m hoping to also integrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push Notifications</li>
<li>App settings</li>

            <hr/>
            <br/>
            <p>Bread and butter of all my languages.</p>
<p>Java is the primary language used by TUS so it is reflected in most of Projects and assignments.</p>
<p>Over the time I have become very proficient with Java but I find myself preferring other languages when presented the option.  Certain limiting design factors draw me away from Java.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of Java aspects that I deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>JDBC</li>
<li>JUnit testing</li>
<li>Java Swing</li>
<li>Multi-threading and Asynchronous programming</li>
</ul>

        <div class="timeline-description" style="display: none;" id="programing_language_js">
            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <hr/>
            <br/>
            <p>Somehow this has become a staple for starting out many project ideas.</p>
<p>Majority of my exploratory projects have started out in JavaScript and it has proved to be great learning tool due to it’s easy of use. Much of my skill can be attributed to JavaScript.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When it comes to JavaScript I have worked with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating APIs</li>
<li>Web compression using Z-lib</li>
<li>Web scraping</li>
<li>Web design</li>
</ul>

        </div>
    
        <div class="timeline-description" style="display: none;" id="programing_language_ts">
            <h2>TypeScript</h2>
            <hr/>
            <br/>
            <p>A more preferred version of JavaScript</p>
<p>I had little opportunity to work with TypeScript as I don’t find it too suited for minor projects or coding exercises, but I do find it to be “improved” version of JavaScript. Features it provides and especially types are extremely appealing to work with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first time I had a chance to work with Node.js was using TypeScript.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I would like to use TypeScript more but as it sits JavaScript is more approachable solution for quick projects and exercises.</p>

        <div class="timeline-description" style="display: none;" id="programing_language_dart">
            <h2>Dart</h2>
            <hr/>
            <br/>
            <p>Dart was an odd language to pick up on and it was only due to developing an App in Flutter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The language is relatively complex with its own nuances, but it feels a lot like Java or C# which I have extensive experience with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m not too certain where I would use Dart outside of Flutter but developing apps with it feels a lot more streamlined and fast compared to Android Studio.</p>

        <div class="timeline-description" style="display: none;" id="programing_language_cs">
            <h2>C#</h2>
            <hr/>
            <br/>
            <p>C#, what I like to consider to be a more handsome cousins of Java.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my experience with C# is lesser but I found majority of my skills of Java to be extremely transferable. Combined with the extra features it offers and general coding conventions I find myself enjoying it the most out of all languages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most of my experience comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.net</li>
<li>Godot</li>
<li>Unity</li>

            <hr/>
            <br/>
            <p>The only language that I have actual work experience with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not too fond of Python due to it&rsquo;s scripting nature and coding conventions, but even I must admit that it is an excellent choice to achieve results.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have worked with:</p>
<ul>
<li>PyTest (with Alure)</li>
<li>Web scraping</li>
<li>Multi-threading / Async</li>
<li>Machine learning</li>

<p>This time I had previous knowledge and skills that I was able to build upon during the school semester.
I became a lot more proficient with Containerisations as a whole and Docker became second nature.
Kubernetes still proved difficult to work with, but I had greater success that I did before.</p>
<p>Throughout my time I managed to work more on new test suites for automated pipelines as well as paving the way to some more automation of repetitive tasks.
Although I still felt a little out of depth I managed to keep up with the pressure and my learning was significantly accelerated because of it.</p>
