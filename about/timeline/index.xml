      <description>First work experience in the sofware field after 2nd year of study. I was part of DevOps / Continuous Integration team.
This was very much out of my comfort zone and I had to pick up on many new skills like Containerization, Docker and Kubernetes. I found it very overwhelming but it proved very helpful at learning these new skills.
I was difficul to keep up with tasks but I was able to integrate new automated tests suites.</description>

      <description>3rd year work placement back with Ericsson and the same team as before.
This time I had previous knowledge and skills that I was able to build upon during the school semester. I became a lot more proficient with Containerisations as a whole and Docker became second nature. Kubernetes still proved difficult to work with, but I had greater success that I did before.
Throughout my time I managed to work more on new test suites for automated pipelines as well as paving the way to some more automation of repetitive tasks.</description>
