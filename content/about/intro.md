I'm a software developer in my final year of study:

&nbsp;&nbsp; Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest

&nbsp;&nbsp; BSc (Hons) degree in Software Design (Cloud Computing)

&nbsp;

I enjoy software development of any kind, but I do prefer programming with strongly typed languages. I aim to be a jack of all trades when it comes to software and with majority of my projects I try to expand into as many fields as I can. Below you can read more about some of my skills and programming languages Iâ€™ve had experience with. Feel free to explore my projects (that I try to keep up to date).
