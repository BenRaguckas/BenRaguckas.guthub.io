C#, what I like to consider to be a more handsome cousins of Java.

Unfortunately, my experience with C# is lesser but I found majority of my skills of Java to be extremely transferable. Combined with the extra features it offers and general coding conventions I find myself enjoying it the most out of all languages.

Most of my experience comes from:

* ASP.net
* Godot
* Unity
