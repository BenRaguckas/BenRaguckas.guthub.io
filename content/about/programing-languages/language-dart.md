Dart was an odd language to pick up on and it was only due to developing an App in Flutter.

&nbsp;

The language is relatively complex with its own nuances, but it feels a lot like Java or C# which I have extensive experience with.

&nbsp;

Iâ€™m not too certain where I would use Dart outside of Flutter but developing apps with it feels a lot more streamlined and fast compared to Android Studio.
