Bread and butter of all my languages.

Java is the primary language used by TUS so it is reflected in most of Projects and assignments.

Over the time I have become very proficient with Java but I find myself preferring other languages when presented the option.  Certain limiting design factors draw me away from Java.

Some of Java aspects that I deal with:

* JDBC
* JUnit testing
* Java Swing
* Multi-threading and Asynchronous programming
