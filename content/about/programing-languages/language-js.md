Somehow this has become a staple for starting out many project ideas.

Majority of my exploratory projects have started out in JavaScript and it has proved to be great learning tool due to itâ€™s easy of use. Much of my skill can be attributed to JavaScript.

When it comes to JavaScript I have worked with:

* Creating APIs
* Web compression using Z-lib
* Web scraping
* Web design
