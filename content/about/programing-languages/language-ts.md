A more preferred version of JavaScript

I had little opportunity to work with TypeScript as I don’t find it too suited for minor projects or coding exercises, but I do find it to be “improved” version of JavaScript. Features it provides and especially types are extremely appealing to work with.

The first time I had a chance to work with Node.js was using TypeScript.

I would like to use TypeScript more but as it sits JavaScript is more approachable solution for quick projects and exercises.
