A more of a past-time that has developed into a complex project. What initially began as an idea for Android Studio app has since moved onto Flutter for more streamlined development experience.

I have developed few demo apps in Android Studio but since I had moved to Flutter I have been focused on a single Time-table app project. It utilizes few different elements and has become a passion project of mine for the time being.

Some current features:

* Web requests
* HTML parsing
* Dynamic Display
* Using MVC pattern

&nbsp;

Iâ€™m hoping to also integrate:
* Push Notifications
* App settings
