My primary work experience.

&nbsp;

I had to work as part of DevOps team maintaining and ensuring successful deployment of a product.

I have worked with Docker, Kubernetes, Helm utilizing Jenkins and Spinnaker for pipelines and automation.

While working we dealt little with code but were responsible for its integration, deployment, documentation and testing.
