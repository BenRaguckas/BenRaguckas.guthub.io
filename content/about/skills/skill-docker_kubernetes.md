I have learned a lot about Docker and Kubernetes in my work placement.

Over the time I have also tried to apply these skills to personal project where I was able to deploy a local web-app on Raspberry Pi through Docker.
I also apply it in projects / assignments wherever possible.

My Final Year Project is oriented around Containerisation and Orchestration. Where Iâ€™m trying to deploy a full stack application utilizing message broker and orchestrated using Helm and Kubernetes.
