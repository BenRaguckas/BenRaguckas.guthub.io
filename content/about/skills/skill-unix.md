In my work placement I had to deal with Unix based systems heavily. But even before that I was familiar with them from virtualization side. Since then, I ended up using Ubuntu on my personal laptop to speed up any development processes and I have become comfortable interfacing with servers or VMs through terminals.

Some systems I have dealt with:
* Ubuntu
* Raspbian
* Solaris
