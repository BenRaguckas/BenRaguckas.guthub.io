3rd year work placement back with Ericsson and the same team as before.

This time I had previous knowledge and skills that I was able to build upon during the school semester.
I became a lot more proficient with Containerisations as a whole and Docker became second nature.
Kubernetes still proved difficult to work with, but I had greater success that I did before.

Throughout my time I managed to work more on new test suites for automated pipelines as well as paving the way to some more automation of repetitive tasks.
Although I still felt a little out of depth I managed to keep up with the pressure and my learning was significantly accelerated because of it.
