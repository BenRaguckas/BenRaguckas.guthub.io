First work experience in the sofware field after 2nd year of study.
I was part of DevOps / Continuous Integration team.

This was very much out of my comfort zone and I had to pick up on many new skills like Containerization, Docker and Kubernetes.
I found it very overwhelming but it proved very helpful at learning these new skills.

I was difficul to keep up with tasks but I was able to integrate new automated tests suites.
