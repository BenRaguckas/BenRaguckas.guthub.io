My final year project that is focused on developing a full stack application utilizing microservice architecture, orchestration and message broker.

&nbsp;

My goal is to deploy a full stack application with scalable and orchestrated structure for easier maintenance, upgradability, deployment and most importantly learning.

&nbsp;

It is very early in development and nothing of it can be showcased.
