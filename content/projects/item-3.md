A personal project of mine to automate and streamline timetable viewing experience for my college.

&nbsp;

What originally began as an Android Studio project has since moved to Flutter for ease of development, ease of building to different platforms and general performance issues I was facing. Although the project is fairly far in itâ€™s progress it is difficult to showcase as majority of work is foundational and proper usability will likely only happen at ~85% completion with the remainder being polish of UX / UI.

On hold until exams are over.
