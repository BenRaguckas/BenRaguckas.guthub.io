This very page that I built from scratch using HUGO.

&nbsp;

It was an idea I had for a while that was pushed forward due to an assignment requirement.

It is still in its early stage most notably lacking responsiveness and higher level of polish.

Still WiP as I plan to improve and add to it to improve workflow.
