      <description>This very page that I built from scratch using HUGO.
It was an idea I had for a while that was pushed forward due to an assignment requirement.
It is still in its early stage most notably lacking responsiveness and higher level of polish.
Still WiP as I plan to improve and add to it to improve workflow.</description>
