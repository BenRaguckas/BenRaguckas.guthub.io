      <description>A personal project of mine to automate and streamline timetable viewing experience for my college.
What originally began as an Android Studio project has since moved to Flutter for ease of development, ease of building to different platforms and general performance issues I was facing. Although the project is fairly far in itâ€™s progress it is difficult to showcase as majority of work is foundational and proper usability will likely only happen at ~85% completion with the remainder being polish of UX / UI.</description>
